	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

	  Select the compression method used by zram.
	  LZO is the default. Snappy compresses a bit worse (around ~2%) but
	  much (~2x) faster, at least on x86-64.
