         This is an experimental driver for the cw1200 chip-set.
         Enabling this option enables the generic driver without
         any platform support.

         Please select the appropriate platform below.

        Say N here only if you are running the driver on a platform
        which does not have support for non-power-of-two SDIO transfer.
        If unsure, say Y.

        Say Y here if you want to include GPIO IRQ support instead of SDIO IRQ.
        If unsure, say N.

      help
        Say Y if your firmware does not support keep-alive functionality
        or you suspect problems with the implementation.
        Please finalize software the software keep-alive functionality in
        that case.
        If unsure, say N.

        Say Y if your device supports 5GHz band. Should be disabled for
        CW1100 silicon.
