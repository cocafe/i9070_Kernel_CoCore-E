Description:    The adc0volt attribute allows the userspace to read the
                voltage of the device connected to the General Purpose
                Analog to Digital Converter (GPADC) channel-0. Voltage
                conversion from analog to digital happens only when this
                attribute is read. GPADC block is present in AB5500 chip
                and has input voltage range of 0-1.8 volt for GPADC Ch-0.
                It provides result of the converted voltage in 10 bits.
                Other GPADC channels attributes may appear in this path
                later. For minimum and maximum input voltage range for
                each channel please refer to the ST-Ericssons AB5500
                datasheet. An example usage of GPADC can be an ALS device
                connected to the channel and user space adapts the
                LCD backlight brightness based on ambient light value
                read from the attribute.
